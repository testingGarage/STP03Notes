# Day 1 - Setting the Context
### SmartQA Transformation Program (STP) Cohort3 Notes for 25 March 2025

I read and heard this word "Cohort".  I did not the menaing of it and never attempted to the meaning of it.  I'm not a native English person.  I tried to understand the meaning of this word before I attented this class.  Here is what I found on web:

>> Cohort -- A chhort is a "group" or "band" of people who have something in common such as being born in the same year, graduating from the same class or having a similar experience.

--- Start of the notes ----

## 1. Started with Premable
    - *Limited View* of testing - as an act of doing
    - *Incorrect Dichotomy* - manual & automation testing
    - *Incomplete View* of testeing - as possibly compliance/checking
    - *Limited Approach* to testing - as driven by document or random
    - *False Trust* - automated testig may be superior
    - *Myth* - Testing is driven by experience

> Ashok shared how the current state of testing is perceived to be the above, while it is not.  Further he said, there is a need for transformation with a focus.
>> Doing vs Probing,
>> Process vs Practice,
>> Machine vs Intellect,
>> Check (comply) vs Test (discover),
>> Experience vs Method,
>> Detection vs Preemption,
>> Doing More vs To do Less

## 2. The shift is needed
    - from an act of DOING to PROBING
    - from doing MORE to doing LESS
    - from a role of DOER to that of VALUE DELIVERER

## 3. He defined,
    > Testing is DEEP PROBING, not mere code validation requires smart THINKING + great HABITS
-   He said, this program **nurtures a deep probing mindset** and **builds habits** for smart assurance.
> "Habits shapre your identity. You get what you repeat." ~ James Clear, Author of Atomic Habits
## 4. This is a TRANSFORMATION sessions is what I understand
    - Personal transformation at individual, team, org and customer level
        - of mindset
        - of activities
        - of outcomes
        - of role & value
    - Outcomes
        - do effectively -> think well
        - do efficiently -> do well
        - do less -> accomplish more
## 5. What is SmartQA?
> ... is an intellect practice of probing deeper to seek clarity & in the process uncover, preempt issues rapidly, not limited to mere validation of code.
>> it is about "doing less to accomplish more".

    - SmartQA
        - Do less, Acomplish ore
        - Human powered, machine aided
        - Detect well, strive to prevent
        - Be lean, stay agile

## 6. Checking vs Testing 
    - Credited Micahel Bolton for this framing
    - Earlier, testing was viwed as
        - checking compliance
        - checking if system met specifications
        > This looked fine for detailed specifications making us believe it was complete
        >> Truly, no specification can be deemed complete as there is no way to prove this!
    - So, we matured, revising our thinking.
        - Testing was viewed as exploration.
            - To understand well, in the process sport anomolies, and suggest ideas that add value to end user/scustomers.
    - Checking
        - based on spec
        - wellness
        - AUTOMATED
    - Testing
        - beyond spec
        - illness
        - HUMAN
    - The Big Picture

| Testing | Checking | Objective |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| DevTest(UT,IT) | QA test (System Test)      | Role       |
| in the Small| in the Large      | Entity     |
| Functional Test               | Non-functional test      | What to find       |
 by Human | Automated | How to find |
| System POV | User POV | POV |
| New | Modified | State |
| Detect | Prevent (Shift-left) | Value |


## 7. QA - What is their Role?
    - Shift LEFT to do less 
        - Suggestor
        - Questioner
        - Designer
    - Shift RIGHT to add value
        - Automator
        - Executor
        - Analyzer
## 8. The granularity of Entity Under Test (EUT) -- What to Test?
    - business Flow - A set of tasks by different users to accomplish a business objective
    - User Requirement - enables an user to do a task
    - technical Feature - basic offering from system
    - Structural Component - basic building block

    If I get lost too much in the early stage, I will lose the top; likewise, if I get lost too much in top, I will lose the bottom.

    I need to have a Telescope and Microscope.  I cannot use the same at the same time to look.

    > What am I testing here?

    - I should be having a Microsocope and Telescope, and I should be using them in how I think about what I'm testing and how I will be testing.
## 9. Discussio #1 
    - Responsibility & Accountability of different folks in SDLC wrt Q
    > Requirement Q, Implementation Q, Validation Q
    
    - We state that Q is the responsibility of all (PO, Dev, QA)
    - So what is the responsibility of each these folks towards Q?
    - How do we measure these are well set, including taking accountability of misses?
All of us have the accountability of the miss!  Undertanding the type of issue makes it better to clasify.

## 10. Fractional Distillation

| Input | Refinary Gas | Byproduct
|:------ | :-------:| -------:|
| CRUDE OIL | Fractional | Petrol |
| | | Naphtha|
| | | Kerosene |
| | | Diesel Oil |
| | Residue | |


    - A method for separating mixtures.
        - It is used for refining crude oil.
        - Each stage of colunn removes a    constituent of the mixture utiliing the differential boiling points of constituients.


    - Apply this to testing software
        - Think of SUT as a mixture of issues
            - Different tests uncover different issues at various levels.
            - Sharpens focus on what to find, how to find and when.
            - Enables scenarios to be minimal, crisp and complete.

| Input | Software Testing | Type of Issues
|:------ | :-------:| -------:|
| SUT | Tests | Deployment Issues |
| | | Attribute Issues|
| | | Behavior Issues |
| | | UI/Interface Issues |


- Focus and Objective
- Do not explore without an objective
- The question is where to start.
- Understand the role of yours

## 11. Quality Levels and Types of Issues

| Satisfy Quality Level | by Test for Issues |
|:------ | :-------|
| L9 End user value | User acceptance test |
| L8 Deployment correctness|Deployment test, Data migration test, Installation & CFG test |
| L7 Attribute correctess| Load tests, performance test, security test, attribute test|
| L6 Environment correctness|Configuration test - compatibility issues |
| L5 Flow correctness |Use case test - Higher order behavior; End-to-end test - Business flow issues|
|L4 Behavior correctness |Functiona tests - Behavior correctness; Access control tests - Roles & access issues |
| L3 Structural correctness |Resources, Exceptions, Timeouts, Synchronization, Side effects, Coverage|
|L2 Interface correctness |UI interface, Data, Message, File format|
|L1 Input correctness |Input validation tests - Limits, duplicates, data type, non-unqiue, data dependency|

- It took years for Ashok to arrive at this 9 layers.  It can be beyond 10 as well for you!  That is not a problem at all.

- Level, Type and Test Design Techniques are Orthogonal
    - Quality Level --> Test Type --> Test Techniques -- focuses on discovering on a particular type of problems
    - Say,
        - X-axis: Quality Level
        - Y-axis: Test Techniques
        - Z-axis: Test Type
    - What does this mean?
    > Certain type of problems are uncovered by a specific test, to mee a given quality level, with scenario/cases for that test designed using specific test techniques.

- Unit, Integration and System tests are Test Levels similar to Quality Levels
    - Quality Leve seems more objective focused on issues to uncover, whereas, UT, IT and ST are not that clear.

- Test scenarios represent behaivors
- Test Cases are stimuli

## 12. Disscusion #2 - Role of process, practice, tool & technology in delivering great Q.

--- End of Day 1 Session ---


# **My Interpretation and Learning from Day 1 Session**
0. This session is more about framing the mindset and attitude.
    1. I see this is important and needed.
    2. It helped me to see what Ashok has.
1. As Ashok said, there is nothing right or wrong
    1. It is all about the Habits, Perspectives, Practice
    2. It is open ended in learning, discovering and exploring, and so is the testing.
2. The use of word "Habits" gave me a fresh oreintation to my perspectives
    1. If one as to progress, there has to be change in the habit! Wow!
    2. The same holds good for an engineer like me.
3. I see, Ashok and other senior Test Engineering practitioners in the Industry with whom I'm ineracting and associated, all advocate the same.
    1. Just the way of expressing and how it is put across is the difference.
    2. Otherwise, all the senior practitioners mean the same while they have their own unique valid perspectives to it.
4. **One of mey key take aways from this session is Quality Levels which is envisioned by Ashok from his practice**.
    1. I can use this in my communiation and it helps a lot with certain stakeholders
    2. This thought of Ashok gives a qualitative and qunatitative sight for stakeholders who can probe more into it with a Test Engineer
        - Yes, "**probe**", the word which Ashok highlighted multiple times in the session
        - A test is a probe to discover, learn and analyze.
