# STP Notes

This repo contains my notes, interpretation and assignments from the classes of doSmartQA/INDIVIDUAL **SmartQA Transformation Program (STP)**. [^1]  

The classes are conducted by Ashok Thiruvengadam. [^2]

I have categorized notes for the session of that respective day.  

I have retained and used the same the terms/words of Ashok in the notes that I have made.

In my opinion this classes are helpful in building the mindset and it aids to construct the attitude needed for the Software Testing & Engineering.  Practicing this consistently should help one to figure out and know the perspectives of practices in the Software Engineering.
